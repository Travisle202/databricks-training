What it shows: It illustrates how clusters merge together as you allow for greater and greater distances (lower density) .
The Bottom: Each individual data point starts at the bottom as its own tiny cluster  .
The Merges: As you move up the tree, clusters start combining (merging). The height of the merge line tells you the distance (or density level) at which they came together .
Low Merges (Low on the tree): These merges happened quickly because the points were very close and in a high-density region .
High Merges (High on the tree): These merges happened late because the points or clusters were far apart and in a low-density region .
