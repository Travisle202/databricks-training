Here is a simplified explanation:
Calculate Core Distance: For every data point, HDBSCAN first determines its "core distance," which is the distance to its $k$-th nearest neighbor (where $k$ is a parameter like min_samples) .
In a dense area: If a point is surrounded by many others, its core distance will be small.
In a sparse area: If a point is isolated, its core distance will be large.
Calculate Mutual Reachability Distance: This new distance between any two points ($a$ and $b$) is defined by taking the maximum of three values: the core distance of point $a$, the core distance of point $b$, and the original distance between $a$ and $b$ .
The Result (The Transformation):
For points in a dense cluster: Both core distances are small, so the mutual reachability distance is usually just their original, true distance. They remain close together .
For points in sparse areas (noise): If one or both points are in a sparse area, their large core distances "push out" the mutual reachability distance, making these points seem much further away from everything else .
In simple terms: This transformation effectively makes points in dense areas stick closer together, while points in sparse areas (potential noise/outliers) are artificially isolated and pushed further away from all other points  . This step incorporates density into the distance measure itself, which is crucial for HDBSCAN's ability to find clusters of varying densities .
